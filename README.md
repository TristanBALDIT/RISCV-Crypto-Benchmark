# RISCV-Crypto-Benchmark

**RISCV-Crypto-Benchmark** is a project designed to measure the performance of some cryptographic algorithms on **RISC-V THALES SOFTCORE CV32A6** architecture emulated on **ZYBO Z7-20** board. 
This benchmark enables the evaluation and comparison of differents cryptographics algorithms in terms of numbers of instructions and cycles used. 

It is based on the **THALES CVA6 SOFTCORE CONTEST** toolchain (publicly available here : https://github.com/ThalesGroup/cva6-softcore-contest/blob/cv32a6_contest_24_25).

In addition, it contains some plotting python scripts already loaded with some of my measured datas.
